## dplyr-nycflights-r

The data-set ‘nycflights13’ has information on the airline on-time data for all flights departing NYC in 2013.  It also includes useful 'metadata' on airlines, airports, weather, and planes. I used the dplyr package in R to transform and summarize this data for data analysis and processing. Some of the methods used in code are arrange, filter, select, mutate and summarize.
